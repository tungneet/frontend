                <div class="faq-answer">
                    ECFMG (Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates) Certification is mandatory for all International Medical Graduates to be eligible for US residency programs. It verifies your medical education credentials, ensures you meet US standards, and serves as a prerequisite for the NRMP Match. Without ECFMG certification, you cannot participate in the residency match process.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    You must pass USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 CK (Clinical Knowledge) for ECFMG certification. Step 1 tests basic medical sciences, while Step 2 CK evaluates clinical knowledge and patient care skills. Step 3 is not required for certification but may be needed for certain visa types or programs.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    The ECFMG certification process typically takes 4-8 weeks after all requirements are met. This includes credential verification, exam score reporting, and final certificate issuance. However, delays can occur due to document verification issues or high application volumes.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    For IMGs, competitive scores vary by specialty: Step 1: 240+ (highly competitive), 220-240 (competitive), 200-220 (acceptable for some programs). Step 2 CK: 250+ (excellent), 240-250 (very good), 230-240 (good). Remember, Step 1 is now Pass/Fail, making Step 2 CK scores more critical.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    You have 6 attempts for each USMLE Step within a 7-year period. Multiple attempts can impact your application negatively, so thorough preparation is crucial. Programs often view first-attempt passes more favorably than multiple attempts.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    USCE refers to clinical rotations, observerships, or research experiences in US healthcare settings. It's crucial for IMGs as it demonstrates familiarity with the US healthcare system, provides networking opportunities, and helps secure strong letters of recommendation from US physicians.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Hands-on clinical rotations (externships/sub-internships) are most valued, followed by observerships with meaningful patient interaction. Research experiences in US institutions are also valuable, especially if they lead to publications. Avoid purely observational experiences with minimal interaction.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    IMGs typically apply to 80-150 programs depending on their competitiveness and specialty choice. Highly competitive specialties may require 150+ applications, while primary care specialties might need 80-120. Quality over quantity is important - research programs thoroughly.

                    Prepare by researching each program thoroughly, practicing common questions (Why this specialty? Why our program? Tell me about yourself), preparing stories that highlight your strengths, understanding current healthcare issues, and being ready to address any gaps or weaknesses in your application professionally.

                    If you don't match, you can participate in SOAP (Supplemental Offer and Acceptance Program) immediately after Match Day. If unsuccessful in SOAP, options include taking a research year, gaining more USCE, improving USMLE scores, considering preliminary/transitional year programs, or applying again next cycle.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    The two main visa types are J-1 and H-1B. J-1 is more common, easier to obtain, but requires returning to home country for 2 years after training (unless waived). H-1B allows dual intent (path to green card) but is harder to obtain and requires Step 3 passage before residency.
